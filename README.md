# Uber_tipsAnalysis

Uber has been a major source of travel for people living in urban areas. Some people don’t have their vehicles while some don’t drive their vehicles intentionally 
because of their busy schedule. So different kinds of people are using the services of Uber and other taxi services. 

By analyzing Uber trips, we can draw many patterns like which day has the highest and the lowest trips or the busiest hour for Uber and many other patterns.
The dataset I’m using here is based on Uber trips from New York, a city with a very complex transportation system with a large residential community.

The dataset contains data of about 4.5 million uber pickups in New York City from April to September and 14.3 million pickups from January to June 2015. 
You can do so much more with this dataset rather than just analyzing it.
